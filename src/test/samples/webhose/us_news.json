      "text": "How COVID Has Affected Travel Discover how COVID-19 has changed people’s travel habits and impacted the industry. Jun 24, 2020 at 11:53AM Author Bio Full-time host of the Motley Fool Money radio show, MarketFoolery podcast, and other things. Part-time connoisseur of movies, basketball & fine bourbon.\nIn this episode of Market Foolery , Chris Hill chats with Motley Fool contributor Dan Kline about the latest news from Wall Street. They've got the latest headlines from the airlines and the travel industry, an iconic brand is up for grabs for anyone with deep pockets, and much more.\nTo catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center . To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks . A full transcript follows the video.\nThis video was recorded on June 22, 2020.\nChris Hill: It's Monday, June 22. Welcome to Market Foolery . I'm Chris Hill. With me today: our man in Florida, it's Dan Kline. Good to see you.\nDan Kline: Nice to see you, Chris.\nHill: Belated Happy Father's Day!\nKline: Thank you. Did you do anything exciting yesterday?\nHill: I grilled some meat, because it's Father's Day, you know, anyone with a grill should be able to grill whatever they want on their day.\nKline: I went to Texas de Brazil, so similar theme, except I didn't have to cook.\nHill: [laughs] We've got a wonderful buying opportunity for anyone out there who wants to own an iconic brand, but we're going to start today with the airlines.\nBoth United and American Airlines are in the news because both of them are looking to raise a lot of money. American Airlines is reportedly going to be raising up to $3.5 billion, and United is going to be raising up to $5 billion. How bad is it out there for the airlines? Because when I look at this -- and look, I know these are huge businesses, but this is probably not what you want to see if you're looking to own shares of these companies.\nKline: Yeah, this is bad news. So the estimates are, they're losing $45 million a day. And you know, everyone's acting like we're back to business as usual. The reality is, we're back to some flights at limited capacity, and you probably didn't pay that much to be on [laughs] those flights. So airlines are in real trouble until there is a cure or some method of keeping you safe on planes. If they make every seat some sort of individual plexiglass pod, I guess [laughs] maybe that could work, but I'm not even sure how that would work with loading and offloading -- at best you're looking at two-thirds capacity and most routes are going to have lower pricing.\nI know I've booked some flights; I don't know if I'll take them, but I've booked some flights and the pricing was very, very low. So this is a lot of pain. And starting at the end of September, they can lay some people off. They're trying with buyouts and other offers to reduce their workforce, but these are companies that are not going to be back to normal for maybe years. And I point out, I'm a travel optimist.\nHill: [laughs] Yeah, I was going to say, you're one of the more optimistic people I've heard talking about the travel industry in general, whether we're talking about people getting back to casinos or the airlines or the cruise lines. I saw a clip this morning, an interview, that's going to be running tonight on HBO. Ed Bastian, who's the CEO of Delta Airlines , talking about masks on their planes, and basically saying, \"Look, we're not going to remove people from the plane if they take their mask off.\" And it's a tough spot that they're in, because -- particularly, when you think about longer flights, it's not hard to imagine for, sort of, the shorter trips where the flying time is maybe an hour, and so part of the safety procedures involved, we're not going to be doing drinks and snacks. Everyone needs to stay seated, keep their masks on.\nWhen you start thinking, Dan, about cross-country flights, then you get into an area where it's, like, \"Well, wait a minute. If I'm going to be on a plane for five or six [laughs] hours, I'm probably going to want to use the facilities at some point, I'm probably going to want to eat something or drink something.\" So they're in a really tough spot.\nKline: They're not stopping people from bringing their own drinks on board, but there are some things they could do. Instead of doing drink service all in order, they could do every other row. So you finish your drink before I got mine, and my mask goes back on. The problem with this is, is that, at least here in Florida, people have not shown a willingness to wear masks. The restaurant I ate at last night, the restaurant did everything really well, and you were supposed to be wearing a mask until they served you food or beverage. And I would say it was 50/50 whether people did that. And honestly, it was a tiny bit uncomfortable. I'm not sure I want to be on a plane and a person behind me is blatantly not wearing a mask, and I don't mean they're taking their mask off carefully to have a cup of coffee and then they're putting it back on.\nI get it that masks aren't super comfortable. I've ordered about 10 different masks to try to find the most comfortable one. I know my son has been wearing the neck gaiter, and that's really comfortable, because he's got a small neck. It doesn't work as well for me. Look, you can find a mask that's comfortable, you could wear a face shield if you want, there's all sorts of options out there. And I think right now, the airline should be enforcing this, they should be -- even the perception of it is important. They've changed their filters. They're doing lots of things to keep you safe.\nI don't believe flying on a plane, if people are wearing masks and there's reasonable precautions, is that dangerous. On the other hand, if people are completely ignoring the rules and they're walking to the bathroom while drinking a soda and sneezing without wearing a mask, that does seem to increase my danger. And, look, I get the politics of it, why the airlines don't want to make hard-and-fast rules, but I think as a society, maybe we should make some hard-and-fast rules about being nice to each other.\nHill: Last thing on the airlines. There are a chunk of investors out there who look at the airlines, particularly, with their stocks knocked down to the extent that they have been, and they think to themselves, well, look, they're going to survive, they're going to get through this, this is a necessity in our society, so why not take a shot with one of these stocks, why not buy a few shares because it's a value play right now? Do you look at the airline stocks as value plays?\nKline: No, it's a value trap. It's a danger. There should be red lights and crocodiles jumping up, and whatever could scare you away, because airlines could go bankrupt. That doesn't mean they're going to go out of business, Chris. We've talked about this with cruise lines. The banks don't particularly want to own cruise ships and they don't want to own airplanes. These routes need to be flown, so what could happen -- and they're taking steps for that not to happen -- but if this goes on for an extra long period of time, they'll file Chapter 11, they'll get out of some of their debt, the same people will be in-charge, some executives will get bonuses and shareholders will get wiped out. That is how it goes. So if you invest in an airline, you're making the bet, this will recover over the long term without there being a bankruptcy in the interim. I might make that bet on Southwest ; I am not making that bet on any other airline.\nHill: Second quarter earnings for TripAdvisor ( NASDAQ:TRIP ) are scheduled for early August, but we got indications today that it is not going to be pretty. TripAdvisor said it expects revenue for June to be one-fifth of what it was a year ago. And, Dan, TripAdvisor is also quick to point out, \"We've got the money to cover our debt obligations for the rest of this year and all through 2021,\" but that seems like the financial equivalent of damning with faint praise.\nKline: Yeah, that's not great. That's like you go into a meeting with your boss and he looks really upset and he says, well, we're not going to fire you. It's like, \"OK, I'm not getting fired, but something is not good here.\" And travel has rocketed back to 20% of previous volumes; that's not great. And nobody is taking discretionary vacations to -- I mean, there are places you can go, because camping is up, there are some things people will do -- but the amount of people flying to Orlando to go to Disney World, which hasn't even released its official method of reserving days at the park yet, that doesn't happen till June 22, for people that have a resort reservation. Nobody is doing that. Someone like me might fly to Vegas for a few days and carefully gamble. Your average group of buddies that was going to go to Vegas is not going to do that when the city is half shut down. That's true of most destinations.\nChris, let's say, you and I, we're going to have a meeting with, you know, a potential sponsor. We might have flown to do that in person, there's no way we're doing that in person right now, especially if it's someone in New York or Los Angeles or a big city. So there's just going to be less demand for a long time. Do I believe that demand will never come back? I do not. I believe that we will forget about this. This will become the blizzard of '78, a fond memory, as weird as that sounds, that we all tell war stories about 10 years from now. But for the next however long, no, things are going to be really ugly for the travel business.\nHill: They are. And you think about a business like TripAdvisor, which has really stumbled over the last five years. I mean, it's been a pretty steady decline for the stock and for the business. A year ago, this stock was in the mid-$40; today it's at $17/share, so it's a little more than a $2 billion company. I'm wondering if you look at TripAdvisor and think that there is enough there in terms of data, in terms of users, that someone might consider an acquisition. Last week on the show we were talking about Groupon , and for all of the struggles that Groupon has, it still has about 42 million active customers. So there is a price at which someone would be willing to pay for that customer information, and I'm wondering if you see the same thing with TripAdvisor.\nKline: So TripAdvisor would make sense at Booking , it would just fit nicely into their portfolio, or maybe they just close it [laughs] and rotate people into the services they have. It would work at Expedia , it would also work well at a Microsoft or a Google [ Alphabet ]. It would not be a terrible venue for almost anyone to own if the price keeps coming down. Doesn't make a ton of sense as a stand-alone company, it's the smallest fish in a very big pond. But, yeah, absolutely, I think they are an acquisition target, which usually means they're not, by the way. My history on this has been very, very bad with forecasting acquisitions.\nHill: No, but you have to figure, particularly for some of the companies that you mentioned, and you know, Booking, given the challenges that they're facing, they're probably not looking at acquisitions as actively as people at Microsoft and Alphabet. There have to be people [laughs] in Microsoft and Alphabet who, given the strength of those businesses, are maybe even more focused on tuck-in acquisitions than they were at the beginning of the year.\nKline: Yeah, Microsoft tends to buy things that don't automatically fit its portfolio. LinkedIn and Skype would be two big examples of that. This would be a value-add. That said, Microsoft does not have a great history of buying things and extracting added value. In fact, [laughs] they generally do the opposite.\nBut I would think any of the cash-rich tech companies; would it be shocking if Amazon is kicking the tires here? I don't think it would be. Offering travel services ties into so many other things you can do, and think of all the data Amazon has related to travel and travel products. So this would work really well at pretty much any tech company.\nHill: Apollo Global Management is the private equity firm that owns Chuck E. Cheese, and if you've got cash burning a hole in your pocket, they want to hear from you. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apollo is currently fielding offers from potential buyers. This story reads like Apollo is being pretty straightforward. Obviously, anytime you're fielding offers, you want to get more offers. But it seems like there's enough smoke here that there may actually be some fire. Although, Dan, I can't get away from the question: Who wants to buy Chuck E. Cheese and why? Like, is it to keep the Chuck E. Cheese brand or is it just a real estate and restaurant play?\nKline: In my opinion, someone like roughly our age that fondly remembers Chuck E. Cheese for, like, a post-, you know, hockey team breakup party or a birthday party or something, that doesn't recognize that Chuck E. Cheese in 1985 is pretty much Chuck E. Cheese now, except there is a lot better competition out there. I could make an argument for Dave & Buster's ( NASDAQ:PLAY ) working. You could argue that if they made their food better, that they could do enough business on the weekends and during sporting events, that if they could be seen as a restaurant at the mall the rest of the time, they might be profitable.\nChuck E. Cheese has to revamp everything. Its food is terrible. Its games are old. Nobody wants their kids climbing around the hamster thing now. Right now, in this pandemic, there is no way to sanitize a ball pit that -- there wasn't before, folks, [laughs] I'll tell you, those weren't the cleanest places on earth. This feels to me like a nostalgia play.\nAnd maybe owning the Chuck E. Cheese brand would have some value, and maybe you could incorporate it into something else, but as stand-alone restaurants, who as a parent, my kid would want to go to Chuck E. Cheese. And if they had awesome food, maybe he could have talked me into it. If they had some stuff I wanted to do. Chuck E. Cheese was like a last-day, rainy-day, absolutely there's-nothing-else-to-do option. There's going to need to be a lot of money invested here to make this anything at all.\nHill: It really is going to be interesting to see how this plays out for a couple of reasons. One, there are different versions of this, because it's private equity, in terms of what they could do with the debt. Obviously, one possibility is someone just swoops in and buys it all themselves. There could be partnerships involved here.\nBut you mentioned Dave & Buster's. Shares of Dave & Buster's are down 10% today. I have to believe a little bit of that drop is the prospect of what's playing out with Chuck E. Cheese, a private company. The ripple effect of it moving over into Dave & Buster's. Because Dave & Buster's, think about the way -- you know, let's go back to January of this year, prepandemic. Dave & Buster's is a stock that really hadn't moved. I mean, it would move up and down, but it was basically in the same spot in January of this year that it was four, five years ago. And that's at a time when the economy in America is doing very well, when wages are going up. You know, this is a discretionary-income business. Dave & Buster's doesn't need to exist in the same way that airlines need to exist.\nSo like you, I just sort of ... I get a little, you know, twitchy when someone mentions [laughs] Chuck E. Cheese, just for the few times I've been there. But I'm really curious to see how this plays out.\nKline: Dave & Buster's benefits from Chuck E. Cheese going out of business. There's a certain amount of birthday parties that trickles to Dave & Buster's, which would be a better fit at Chuck E. Cheese but also works at Dave & Buster's. But you could argue that Dave& Buster's, in a nonpandemic world, is a very affordable indulgence. It's a, \"Hey, we're not going on vacation, but on school vacation, we'll take the kids to Dave & Buster's.\" It's not a big leap to say they could revamp their menu to make their food a draw on its own right. And it also seems like they're coming into a time where malls are going to be really, really willing to negotiate for any business that eats up space and draws in traffic, which Dave & Buster's theoretically does.\nChuck E. Cheese, that's a tough argument. You're lugging your five-year-old to Chuck E. Cheese, you're probably not walking around the mall after buying a bunch of stuff. You're going out with your friends to watch a football game at Dave & Buster's, you know, the one near us in -- was it Arundel Mills? Not too far from the office, but 40 minutes from the office. After that Dave & Buster's, maybe wandering over to the casino, maybe I'm wandering around the mall. There's more of an argument for Dave & Buster's than there is for a very dated brand in Chuck E. Cheese.\nHill: Dan Kline, always good talking to you. Thanks for being here.\nKline: Thanks for having me.\nHill: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.\nThat's going to do it for this edition of Market Foolery .

I write about electrical equipment, transportation, and multi-industry industrial stocks. Engineer, investment manager and property developer. I'm a firm believer that there is something noble about the industrial sector. Blue collar workers physically making a better world. Follow me on Twitter to receive quick and thorough analysis of your favorite stocks. Follow @LeeSamaha Follow @@LeeSamaha\nIf you are confident that various government entities in the U.S. are making the effort to maintain and enhance the country's infrastructure, then you probably are also confident that companies like Federal Signal ( NYSE:FSS ) and Alamo Group ( NYSE:ALG ) have a bright future. Meanwhile, fans of the growth of wind power in this country and elsewhere will want to take a look at composite wind-blade manufacturer TPI Composites ( NASDAQ:TPIC ) .\nAll three of these small-cap stocks -- small-cap being a reference to companies with market capitalizations under $2 billion -- have the potential to advance to mid-cap status and even reach the $10 billion market cap minimum that begins to designate them as large-cap stocks.\nHere's more about these three companies and why they show such promise to make the large-cap leap. These three stocks are thinking big. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Alamo Group: Current market cap of $1.12 billion\nAlamo's management describes the company as a leader in infrastructure maintenance and agricultural equipment. As such, it operates out of two divisions, namely industrial and agricultural.\nThe industrial division manufactures a wide range of equipment in niche markets such as sewer cleaning equipment, highway excavators, industrial mowers, snowplows, and even river trenchers. Meanwhile, the agricultural division provides mowers, pickers, and landscaping machinery to farmers and ranchers.\nIt's an eclectic mix of products and services and one that's been built up through the acquisition of 27 businesses since 2000. Alamo sales have more than doubled in the last decade and totaled $1.1 billion in 2019, with around $770 million of that revenue coming from the industrial division and $350 million from the agricultural businesses.\nAlamo's growth opportunity comes from consolidating a highly diverse and fragmented market by continuing to make acquisitions. In addition, as it grows, it will find it easier to expand geographically and cross-sell its equipment to existing customers.\nIts expansion plans are made with the knowledge that its end demand is backed by the need for government spending to maintain existing infrastructure, so Alamo is well placed to continue growing.\nTurning to its valuation, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on nearly all companies, and analysts have Alamo's earnings per share declining to $4.42 in 2020 from $5.92 in 2019. Nevertheless, as revenue and earnings recover in 2021, the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8 looks like a decent value for a company positioned in stable end markets. The company's stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 15.8, suggesting the price is currently discounted. Data by YCharts. 2. Federal Signal: Current market cap of $1.73 billion\nLike Alamo, Federal Signal owns a collection of niche businesses serving municipal and industrial customers. Over 80% of its sales are generated by its environmental solutions group (ESG), which provides municipalities with a range of surface and sewer cleaning equipment, road digging and marking equipment, and industrial cleaning machinery.\nThe rest of its revenue comes from its safety and security systems group (SSG), a motley collection of signals, sirens, and warning systems used by the police, municipalities, and industry.\nIt's also a business that has experienced strong growth over the last decade, driven by acquisitions and supported by underlying demand for municipal spending on infrastructure. Data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nManagement believes a combination of organic growth in excess of GDP and targeted acquisitions will lead to high-single-digit revenue growth. Like Alamo, the company is set for a COVID-19 earnings decline in 2020. But as the first chart above indicates, a forward P/E in the mid-teens makes it an attractive option for a company with growth opportunities within relatively stable end markets. 3. TPI Composites: Current market cap of $785 million\nAs the cost of wind power continues to fall, it's likely to become more competitive as a source of electricity production. As such, demand for the technology behind this renewable energy source should go up. That's the fundamental investment case for TPI.\nThe company is the largest U.S. independent manufacturer of composite wind blades, and its customer list reads like a roll call of the leading wind power companies. Vestas , Siemens Gamesa , and General Electric ( NYSE:GE ) are among its largest customers, and its existing contracts provide for $5 billion in revenue through 2023. For reference, the company generated $1.44 billion in sales in 2019.\nThere are probably three key drivers of long-term earnings growth. First, there's the falling cost of wind power and increasing regulation of less environmentally friendly technologies. Indeed, General Electric's management believes this will drive growth in the renewables industry .\nSecond, there's the trend toward manufacturers outsourcing production of blades. According to TPI, only 38% of wind blades were outsourced in 2009 (as opposed to in-house manufacturing), but in 2019 that figure was 63%. Even GE, which acquired a major blade manufacturer in 2017 (LM Wind Power) for $1.65 billion, is expected to continue to significantly outsource production. Onshore wind turbines. Image source: Getty Images.\nThird, the movement toward larger blades will benefit TPI as it tends to build longer blades for the industry.\nWhile there's no guarantee that TPI's customers will expand existing contracts in the future, wind power is clearly a growth industry. And as an independent producer, the company may be favored as a provider over a company like GE's LM Wind Power. All told, TPI looks well set to profit from growth in the industry.

Follow @@bwithbike\nVideo calls have quickly become a new way of life. Meetings for work, classes for our kids, or catching up with friends and relatives are all now virtual events through the magic of software and the internet.\nZoom Video Communications ( NASDAQ:ZM ) has been at the center of this trend, and has seen unprecedented customer growth since December. But not all of this growth was intended. Along the way, the video platform has attracted a huge consumer following, which has changed the company for the better.\nLet's look back at how this happened, the challenges along the way, and what this unplanned customer set means for this growth stock . The platform that just works\nIn 2011, CEO Eric Yuan left his position leading Cisco 's WebEx video conferencing engineering team because the product had so many customer issues that couldn't be fixed without a full refresh. He started Zoom to build a video conferencing tool from the ground up with the vision of making video meetings better than in-person ones. Zoom was launched two years later, and it quickly gained traction as it was known as a product that just works.\nThe company experienced torrid growth, and by the time it went public in March 2019, it had $330 million in annual revenue. The company built its software and growth strategy around a \" land and expand \" model to gain a foothold inside corporate enterprises and then grow its footprint as organizations gradually embraced video as a way to get work done.\nBut then everything changed when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The challenge and opportunity of COVID-19\nAs a gesture of goodwill, in early March 2020 Yuan opened up the Zoom platform to K-12 schools to allow them to conduct remote classes online for free. At the same time, it was \"landing\" new consumer customers with its free limited-function product that was easy to download and worked great. Image source: Zoom.\nBy April 1, Zoom's usage grew 20-fold from its levels just a few months earlier, over 90,000 schools had adopted its free educational service, and the product was experiencing numerous security and privacy issues . Yuan and the management team committed to a 90-day plan to reassign all its engineering resources to fix the issues facing all of its users regardless of whether they were educational, consumers on the free plan, or large corporate organizations. In an open letter explaining the plan, Yuan said \"our platform was built primarily for enterprise customers – large institutions with full IT support...\" He went on to explain that it now had \"a broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways.\"\nThe company has since fixed the major security and privacy issues, and has shared how many new consumer and small business customers it has attracted along this journey. A new consumer segment has emerged\nIn the past, the company hasn't split out data for consumers, but it provided insight to its customers with \"less than 10 employees\" on the most recent earnings call . This segment grew from 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter to 30% of revenue just one quarter later. In absolute dollars, the numbers are even more impressive, growing an amazing 162% to $98 million in first quarter 2020.\nThe company has a realistic expectation that some portion of these customers may drop the service as the crisis passes. But even so, this consumer/small business customer segment is still significant, which prompted a question from the last earnings call on whether the company had a consumer strategy. The CEO's answer is important for investors to understand:\nI do not think we needed to have a specific consumer strategy. Our strategy is, offer one service. No matter where you are, no matter what you do, no matter which device, we just help you to stay connected.\nIt turns out that the features that make the product more secure and address privacy issues are universally important to all customers. The work accomplished during the 90-day plan made the service better for all its customers, no matter if the account has 1,000 users or just one. Zoom's role is expanding\nIn the opening remarks of the recent earnings call, Yuan explained that he was \"proud to see that our platform is serving a critical role beyond our original vision.\" It's important that Zoom is helping people stay connected no matter whether they are a consumer, an educator, or part of a large corporation. The company's brand image, its entire customer base, and its shareholders will benefit from this new perspective for years to come. Motley Fool Returns Stock Advisor S&P 500 449% ",
