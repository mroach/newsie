Chris Christie had harsh words Thursday for the committee investigating allegations of abuse of power and the orchestrated lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, known to many as the \"Bridgegate\" scandal. \"It's absolutely not true and it is a completely, a completely partisan act to be doing the leaking that they are doing,\" he said in response to a reporter's question about claims that his lawyers would not hand over certain documents, citing executive privilege.

    "language": "en",
    "text": "The Political Ticker blog died of old age on Oct. 13, 2014, after eight years of faithful service to CNN's readers. The Ticker began quietly in October 2006, fueled by a realization that a blog could capture and influence the political conversation. It hit 1 million page views during CNN’s 2006 election coverage a month later, and in its heyday became one of the most trafficked forums in political media. But over the next seven years, the Ticker remained static as the media landscape transformed around it. Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram allowed political journalists to reimagine their storytelling, and the media world placed new emphasis on writing with personality and edge. The Ticker is survived by a new era of CNN Politics Digital - an infant with many thrilling moments of growth in the months ahead. On Wednesday, the Ticker will disappear from CNNPolitics.com. The site will get a more streamlined and video-focused look during the remainder of 2014, with more dramatic visual changes coming early next year.

    "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>The Political Ticker blog died of old age on Oct. 13, 2014, after eight years of faithful service to CNN's readers.</p> \n <p>The Ticker began quietly in October 2006, fueled by a realization that a blog could capture and influence the political conversation. It hit 1 million page views during CNN’s 2006 election coverage a month later, and in its heyday became one of the most trafficked forums in political media.</p> \n <p>But over the next seven years, the Ticker remained static as the media landscape transformed around it. Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram allowed political journalists to reimagine their storytelling, and the media world placed new emphasis on writing with personality and edge.</p> \n <p>The Ticker is survived by a new era of CNN Politics Digital - an infant with many thrilling moments of growth in the months ahead.</p> \n <p>On Wednesday, the Ticker will disappear from <a href=\"http://cnn.com/Politics\">CNNPolitics.com</a>. The site will get a more streamlined and video-focused look during the remainder of 2014, with more dramatic visual changes coming early next year.</p> \n <p>Together, they will carry on the original goals of the Ticker - to give CNN’s readers smart political coverage in real time.

    "text": "It's a sliver of good news about a massive data breach that the company first disclosed last week. Attackers accessed as many as 50 million accounts in the largest such breach of Facebook's network. \"We have now analyzed our logs for all third-party apps installed or logged during the attack we discovered last week. That investigation has so far found no evidence that the attackers accessed any apps using Facebook Login.\" said Facebook's Guy Rosen in a statement. On Friday, Facebook (FB) announced unknown attackers had exploited a vulnerability to access the accounts. They were able to view other people's Facebook profiles as if they were the accounts' owners. For example, they could see friends' profiles and updates. Facebook says it closed the loophole on Thursday night, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. The attackers stole Facebook \"access tokens,\" which keep a person logged into their Facebook account over long periods. Facebook reset all 50 million tokens, as well as tokens for an additional 40 million people who had used the \"view as\" feature in the past year as a precautionary step. During a call about the hack last week, Rosen said the attackers would have also been able to access third-party sites using Facebook Login, but the company had found no evidence of them doing so. Hundreds of sites and apps including Tinder, Spotify and Airbnb use Facebook Login, which lets people access the services with their Facebook username and password. Early this week, developers were confused about whether their services had been exposed in the Facebook hack. The company says partners following Facebook \"best practices\" were automatically protected. Some developers might not have followed those rules, and they could have put their users at risk. \"We're sorry that this attack happened — and we'll continue to update people as we find out more,\" Rosen said. -- CNN's Donie O'Sullivan contributed reporting.",

    "language": "en",
    "text": "The high-profileJapanese companies are forming a joint venture called Monet to develop businesses that will use driverless-car technology to offer new services, such as mobile convenience stores and delivery vehicles in which food is prepared en route. SoftBank (SFTBF) will own just over half of Monet, while Toyota (TM) will hold the rest. The new company's name isn't a reference to Claude Monet, the famous French painter, but rather a shortened version of the words \"mobility network.\" Toyota President Akio Toyoda and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son attended the announcement of the project Thursday in Tokyo, a rare joint appearance by the heads of two of Japan's biggest global companies. Toyota first approached SoftBank with the idea of creating a Japanese alliance to try to catch up with global rivals that are developing autonomous driving tech. Around the world, top carmakers and tech companies like Google's parent, Alphabet (GOOGL), and China's Baidu (BIDU) are pouring resources into self-driving vehicles. Driverless vehicles have the potential to cause huge disruption in the auto industry and are also likely totransform the ride-hailing business. Son, SoftBank's billionaire founder, presides over a sprawling empire of artificial intelligence companies, internet businesses and ride-hailing startups, which can collect huge amounts of data on traffic patterns, passengers' requests and other transportation trends. The new venture taps into SoftBank's advantages in tech and data, and Toyota's vehicle-manufacturing expertise. Itsaims include developing ways to tackle problems created by Japan's rapidly aging society and shrinking workforce. Over the next decade, Monet plans to roll out services like self-driving buses that can drive the elderly to grocery stores, hospital shuttles where medical exams can be done on board, and mobile offices. It will focus initially on Japan with a view to expanding globally. SoftBank has already put money into autonomous driving. Its $100 billion tech-focused Vision Fund committed $2.3 billion to General Motors' self-driving car unit GM Cruise earlier this year. On Wednesday, another top Japanese company, Honda (HMC), said it would also invest $2.8 billion in GM Cruise. Toyota has started pumping resources into driverless cars. It set up a new company in March dedicated to the research and development of self-driving vehicles, with plans to invest $2.8 billion to develop a commercially viable autonomous car. Both SoftBank and Toyota have invested in or partnered with some of the world's biggest ride-hailing startups including Uber, China's Didi Chuxing and Singapore-based Grab. The new SoftBank-Toyota venture shows how relations between automakers and tech companies have shifted. Twenty years ago, Son approached Toyota with the idea of connecting the company's Japanese dealerships on the internet. But Toyoda turned him down. Back then, Son said, SoftBank was a small company reaching out to the \"giant rock\" of Toyota. Today, it's the carmaker that's asking him for help. -- CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.",

After all, many modern cars made by others like Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell phone networks. \"We now have ways of accessing our cars we never did before, and consumers aren't quite aware of that. Hackers will try to take advantage of that lack of awareness,\" said Erik Cabetas, managing partner at the consulting firm Include Security. Dhanjani said today's cars should be held to a higher security standard than the average laptop. Not only are they more expensive, but losing control of a car can put lives in danger. \"We can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home,\" Dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. \"The implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level.\" Dhanjani was especially worried about Teslas. Tesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. A single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to Dhanjani. He also found that Tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. That opens up the site to what's known as \"brute-force attacks,\" where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. On Monday afternoon, Tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, Dhanjani said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own Tesla Model S P85+ three weeks ago. He noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. It never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay. Despite the findings, Dhanjani said he isn't uneasy about his own car and can't wait to get back from vacation to drive the Model S parked at home in Bellevue, Wa. However, he's concerned about the security of a Tesla, especially if it were to be the security standard for electric cars. \"The time is right now for Tesla to fix this,\" Dhanjani said. \"As other car manufacturers draw inspiration from Tesla's design and architecture, there will be more people to compromise and launch attacks against.\"",

    "language": "en",
    "text": "Where American or European companies could once expect to find an enormous market hungry for their products, changing tastes and the challenge from new Chinese rivals are forcing them to adopt new strategies to succeed in the world's second biggest economy. The sterner challenge facing big names such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Apple (AAPL) has nothing to do with the trade war. At least, not yet. It's about new competition and increased wealth. \"It doesn't work to just show up anymore,\" said Benjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at consulting firm China Market Research Group, referring to brands that are household names in the West. \"Chinese consumer tastes are evolving rapidly.\" Coca-Cola (CCE) is one of the top companies that's having to adapt to this new reality. \"We've seen a tremendous change in the consumption patterns,\" Curtis Ferguson, the company's China CEO, told CNN at last week's World Economic Forum in the Chinese city of Tianjin. Coke has launched more than 30 new drink brands in China in the past six months and now has about 275 in total, Ferguson said. They range from regular Coke to more exotic varieties with flavorings like yellow bean and apple fiber. Coke even has its own line of teas in China. That's a big change from the Atlanta-based company's previous approach of relying on the strength of its brand. The philosophy was \"let them drink Coke,\" Ferguson said. He argued Western companies can't afford to treat their brands as sacrosanct. \"Either you destroy your own brand in China, or someone else is going to do it for you,\" he said. Starbucks learned the difficulties of shifting Chinese consumer habits the hard way. The coffee chain has about 3,000 stores in the country, making it oneof its top markets. But in June, the company reported a sudden slowdown in growth in China, just weeks after it had announced plans for rapid expansion there. That's partly because it faces growing competition from an upstart local competitor. Luckin Coffee opened its first store in China less than a year ago. Now it has more than 500. Many of its customers order coffees online for delivery or takeout. Chinese consumers are also increasingly turning to delivery apps,like Meituan Dianping, for food or drinks. \"Starbucks has always been slow adopting technology in China,\" Cavender said. Its customers \"were tired of waiting in line to place orders.\" The global coffee giant is now trying to correct course. In August, it teamed up with Alibaba (BABA), China's largest e-commerce company, to launch delivery services. Global carmakers are also scrambling to keep pace with changes in China's auto market, the world's biggest. It's being shaken up by the rapid spread of electric vehicles, which have been promoted through government subsidies, resulting in a crowded market. Francois Provost, Asia-Pacific chairman of Renault (RNLSY), said the French carmaker is now fighting competition from both traditional rivals and new upstarts in China. Local player Nio (NIO), for example, sells an SUV in China that costs about half the price of Tesla's (TSLA) Model X. Sticker price is crucial in China, Provost said, as most customers are first-time buyers. But drivers are also demanding electric vehicles with longer battery life as networks of charging stations are still being built out across the country. \"The big challenge is increasing the efficiency of the range and reducing user costs at the same time,\" Provost said during a paneldiscussion at the World Economic Forum. That will be tough for automakers, he predicts: \"I can't honestly say we have full visibility on this.\" Apple (AAPL) has lost market share in China to local rivals over the past two years. The iPhone accounts for less than 10% of smartphone sales in the country, analysts estimate.In the United States, it accounts for about 40%. Apple is facing fierce competition from Chinese players such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. \"In recent years, Apple has slid quite a lot in the Chinese market,\" said Canalys researcher Mo Jia. \"The very aggressive tech innovation from Chinese brands is changing the high-end landscape.\" The US company's latest models, the XS and XS Max, include features that could boost their appeal in the Chinese market, like dual SIMcards and a larger screen. But analysts are skeptical these will make much difference. \"Apple is fighting a bit of a losing battle,\" Cavender said. -- Sherisse Pham and Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report.",

    "language": "en",
    "text": "During the first quarter, the median sales price for a condo or co-op in Manhattan rose 18.5% year-over-year to $972,000, according to Douglas Elliman. That's more than four times the median U.S. home price of $205,000. Yet, in most parts of the country $972,000 will typically buy you a sprawling three or four-bedroom with a backyard and a garage. Buyers in Manhattan, however, are willing to shell out that amount for one bedrooms with less than 1,000 square feet of living space. Nevertheless, prices are expected to continue to climb. Manhattan's home sales are still below the $1.025 million peak set in the second quarter of 2008, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who calculates the market data for Elliman. But he believes, \"we'll probably get there in the second quarter of 2014.\" Elliman, along with brokers Halstead Property and Corcoran Group, have all reported that sales volume in Manhattan was up 25% or more in the first quarter. And inventory still remains very tight, with homes often being snapped up in bidding wars. Miller said 38% of all sales were either at or above asking price and that has caused a big spike in prices. All three brokers reported that they saw high demand in luxury and high-end sales. With little new residential construction happening, there's not enough homes available to handle all of this buyer demand. Only 367 newly built apartments were sold during the quarter. Many were in ultra-luxury buildings catering to an international clientele of Chinese industrialists, Russian oil billionaires and other foreign tycoons. Also boosting prices: Families seeking large apartments of three bedrooms or more, said Diane Ramirez, the CEO of Halstead. \"Manhattan was often for a segment of your life before you started a family or after you downsized in retirement,\" she said. \"No longer. Now, it's where you want to raise your kids.\" Corcoran reported that 31% of new development closings during the first quarter were for units that had three bedrooms or more. Manhattan's housing shortage has sent many home seekers further afield to the outer boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island. Brooklyn is starting to become even hotter than Manhattan. Brooklyn's Kings Countyis the fastest growing county in the state, with the median price of homes rising 11.2% to $570,110 in the fourth quarter, according to Douglas Elliman, the last data available.",
